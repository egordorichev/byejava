Java to C# converter

### What this is and what this is not
This piece of software is capable of taking valid Java 8 code and converting it to C#, but:

* I've implemented only the things, that I needed, some things (like interfaces), are missing, even tho, they are super simple to add. If you want to see something supported, please, [make an issue](https://github.com/egordorichev/byejava/issues/new).
* C# is super close to Java syntax, but anonymous classes are not a thing, so they **wont work**.
* This tool is not relieble at any means, because it was developed to quickly port over a single codebase

**If you want to contribute, please do it, if you need any features, please, [submit an issue](https://github.com/egordorichev/byejava/issues/new).**
